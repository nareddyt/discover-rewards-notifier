# Explanation of Permissions

As stated in the Privacy Policy, the developers of this extension take privacy seriously.
Therefore, this extension does NOT store any [personally identifiable information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information).

Keep in mind that our extension is [open source](https://github.com/nareddyt/discover-rewards-notifier).

## Read your browsing history

Discover Rewards Notifier requires permission to view your browsing activity.
Your browsing activity is used to determine which retailer's website you're shopping on, allowing Discover Rewards Notifier to find deals and cashback rewards for that retailer.

_Without permission to view your browsing history, Discover Rewards Notifier won't work at all._

Note: The extension only reads your browsing activity, **not** browsing history.
It will only read the current websites that you have open. It will NEVER read your past browsing history.
**As stated in our privacy policy, this data remains on your device and we never collect this data**.

## Read and change your data on [www.tejunareddy.com](https://tejunareddy.com/discover-rewards-notifier/)

Discover Rewards Notifier requires permission to access the [Project Website](https://tejunareddy.com/discover-rewards-notifier/).
This website has the latest Discover Deals and Cashback Rewards data.
So the extension periodically checks this website to download the latest deals and cashback rewards!

_Without permission to access this website, Discover Rewards Notifier may show you out-dated deals and cashback rewards._

Note: The extension only reads data from this website.
It never pushes any data to the website from your device.
**As stated in our privacy policy, data is never sent to our servers**.
